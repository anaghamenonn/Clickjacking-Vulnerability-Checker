## Clickjacking Vulnerability Checker  <br />
This script checks if a list of domains is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks. Clickjacking occurs when a website is embedded inside an iframe on another website without proper protection, potentially tricking users into clicking on hidden elements.

**How It Works** <br />
The script sends an HTTP request to each domain in the list and checks the response headers for the X-Frame-Options header, which helps protect against clickjacking. If the header is missing, the domain is considered vulnerable.

**Prerequisites** <br />
-  Python 3.x installed on your machine
-  requests library (You can install it using pip if not already installed) <br />


**Installation** <br />

1. Clone this repository or download the script file.

2. Install the required dependencies using the following command: <br />
pip install requests

**Usage**

1. Add the domains you want to check in the domains list in the script.
2. Run the script using the command: <br />
python clickjacking_checker.py
3. The script will output whether each domain is vulnerable or not.
